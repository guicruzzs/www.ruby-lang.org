“Programming Ruby” author Dave Thomas of the Pragmatic Programmers
announced plans for a series of Ruby books from the Pragmatic Bookshelf
(the Pragmatic Programmers’ own imprint). “The intent is to create a
series of books with a deeply practical focus. We won’t just document
APIs. Instead, we want to show how to get *value* from those APIs—-how
to solve real-world problems.”

See [the full announcement][1] for more information, including follow-up
guidelines for potential authors.
